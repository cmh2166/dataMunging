Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in Chained (1934), Spencer Tracy in Edison the Man (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet (1945), and Gregory Peck in The Yearling (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films. When he died in 1987, Brown left $12 million to the University of Tennessee. When added to the $1 million donated during his lifetime, the sum made him the largest donor in the university's history.","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:source":"Clarence Brown Collection, MS.1023, Section II, Item 8","dc:relation":"0012_000411_000219_0001","dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

After her mother's death in 1884, Dromgoole returned to Tennessee to care for her ageing father and began a career as a writer. She published her first novel, _The Sunny Side of the Cumberlands_, under the name \"Will Allen\" in 1886. She also studied law with her father and won terms as a clerk in the Tennessee State Senate in 1885 and 1887. She was, however, defeated in 1889 and 1891. After her second defeat, she traveled to Texas, where she taught and wrote for several newspapers. She soon returned to Nashville, where she spent her time with her father until his death in 1897. In 1900, she began writing for the _Nashville Banner_. She was hired as a permanent staff member in 1902 and began writing her popular column, titled \"Song and Story,\" in 1903. She continued this column for 31 years. Dromgoole also volunteered for the U.S. Navy during World War I and was recruited as a yeomanry warrant officer (possibly the first woman to serve in this capacity) in May of 1917.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986. In 2007, Soka sold the property to the National Park Service, which intends to restore and preserve it.","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:subject":["Los Angeles County (Calif.) -- Pictorial works","Brown, Clarence, 1890-1987"]}},"header":{"setSpec":"spc","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","identifier":"spc_4629"}},{"header":{"identifier":"spc_3626","setSpec":"spc","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z"},"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","dc:date":["1982-05-01 - 1982-10-31","10/18/07"],"dc:identifier":["0012_000067_000681_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4337"],"dc:source":"Photographs of Tennessee Cities Collection, MS.0951, Box 2, Folder 9","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:relation":"0012_000067_000681_0001","dc:publisher":"University of Tennesse Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

His wives, Sarah Hawkins and Catherine \"Bonny Kate\" Sherrill, are buried nearby.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:language":"English","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections, Knoxville, Tennessee","dc:title":"Knox County Court House"}},"header":{"identifier":"spc_4126","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc"}},{"header":{"identifier":"spc_4881","setSpec":"spc","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z"},"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:source":"Anna Catherine Wiley Sketches Collection, MS.1287, Box 1, Folder 12 ","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:relation":"cw011294","dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

He also tells Valbret that he is going to marry another woman, and she pleads with him to marry her instead. Remembering his friend Liane Latour (Karen Morley), who killed herself when her lover Raymond Delval (Lewis Stone) left her, Martel goes to Valbret to rekindle their relationship.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","dc:creator":"unknown","dc:identifier":["0012_000067_000670_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4326"],"dc:date":["1982-05-01 - 1982-10-31","10/18/07"],"dc:subject":[{},"Knoxville (Tenn.) -- Fairs","World's Fair of 1982 (Knoxville, Tenn.) -- Pictorial works","Exhibitions -- Tennessee -- Knoxville"],"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections, Knoxville, Tennessee","dc:title":"Chairlifts Near the Base of the State of Tennessee Amphitheater","dc:language":"English","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Unfortunately, she is already married to wealthy Morgan Leroy (Jack McDonald). Simultaneously, Betty (Barbara Bedford), wife of master diver Caleb West (Broerkin Christians), attracts the attention of Bill Lacey (John Gilbert), who works with her husband. When Lacey is injured, Betty takes care of him and eventually agrees to run away with him. She soon repents of her rash action, but her husband will not take her back. Later, Lacey's ship is wrecked near the new lighthouse and West makes a dive to recover his body. Upon returning to the surface, he discovers that Betty has been operating his air pump, and the two reconcile."}},"header":{"datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc","identifier":"spc_3835"}},{"header":{"identifier":"spc_4222","setSpec":"spc","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z"},"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","dc:subject":[{},"Knoxville (Tenn.) -- Buildings, Structures, Etc. -- Pictorial Works"],"dc:date":["1911","10/19/07"],"dc:identifier":["0012_000067_000566_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4222"],"xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:description":"Unidentified home in Knoxville.

Several wings were added in the 1950s, each named after one of the first co-eds to attend the University. Sophronia Strong's ghost was said to watch over the Hall's residents, appearing as a lady dressed in white on her birthday (February 17) and perpetrating various harmless pranks. The last residents of the hall moved out after the 2008 Spring Semester and the building was put to other uses.","dc:creator":"University News Bureau","dc:identifier":["0012_000106_000545_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/3769"],"dc:date":["1925 - 1950","02/27/09"],"dc:subject":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville","Knoxville (Tenn.) -- Pictorial works"],"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:title":"View of Strong Hall (White Avenue Side)","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections","dc:language":"English"}},"header":{"setSpec":"spc","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","identifier":"spc_3769"}},{"header":{"identifier":"spc_4610","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc"},"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections","dc:title":"Mary Cora de Garmo Bryan","dc:language":"English","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:description":"Portrait of Mary Cora de Garmo Bryan.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville.

McClung built Oakwood Mansion for his son, Matthew McClung, in 1870. The house changed hands in 1873, when it became home to Matthew's sister Lucy and her husband, Jacob Lytton Thomas. The home was then located at the outskirts of town, allowing Thomas to farm and raise livestock. Railroad contractor Henry H. Thrasher purchased the house in about 1905 and remodeled it completely, adding porches, columns, and the brick exterior. He sold it in the late 1920s to a group of physicians, who renamed it the Howard-Henderson Hospital. It was briefly known as the Acuff Clinic before becoming the Kingston Pike Motel in the late 1950s. When that enterprise failed, the structure was remodeled and reopened as the Kingston Pike Nursing Home. It continued in this capacity until the early 1990s. It was home to a number of businesses, including a beauty parlor and a restaurant, before Sam Furrow purchased it in 1999. The structure currently serves as office space for a number of enterprises.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:creator":"unknown","dc:date":["1905 - 1930","11/06/07"],"dc:identifier":["0012_000067_000269_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/3925"]}}},{"header":{"identifier":"spc_4237","setSpec":"spc","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z"},"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","dc:subject":["Knoxville Engraving Co.",{},"Knoxville (Tenn.) -- Buildings, Structures, Etc. -- Pictorial Works"],"dc:date":["1924 - 1930","09/10/07"],"dc:identifier":["0012_000067_000581_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4237"],"xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:description":"Completed in 1874, Knoxville's Post Office and Custom House may have been the city's first building to be designed by a professional architect, in this case Alfred B.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate.

He has just been selected as the valedictorian of his high school class, and intends to inject modern anti-capitalist ideas into his speech. His father (Lionel Barrymore) discovers his plans, however, and prevents him from carrying them out. The town later celebrates the Fourth of July, where Richard spends time with his girlfriend, Muriel McComber (Cecilia Parker). The couple is forced to separate, however, when Muriel's father objects to Richard's letters to Muriel quoting such poets as Omar Khayy%C3%A1m and Swinburne. Heartbroken, Richard goes to a bar, gets drunk, and meets a young prostitute named Belle (Helen Flint). His alcoholic uncle Sid (Wallace Beery) nurses him back to sobriety, but before he can face his parents, he sneaks out to meet Muriel. On his return home, he and his father (who has previously discovered that Muriel's father has changed his mind about Richard) have a talk about the dangers of alcohol and promiscuous women, and all ends well.","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:subject":["Brown, Clarence, 1890-1987","Motion picture producers and directors -- United States","Motion pictures -- United States"],"dc:language":"English","dc:title":"Clarence Brown Directing \"Ah!

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

Fascinated with movies, he moved to New Jersey where he studied with French director Maurice Tourneur at Peerless Studios. There, the pair directed \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1920). Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in \"Chained\" (1934), Spencer Tracy in \"Edison the Man\" (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in \"National Velvet\" (1945), and Gregory Peck in \"The Yearling\" (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films. When he died in 1987, Brown left $12 million to the University of Tennessee. When added to the $1 million donated during his lifetime, the sum made him the largest donor in the university's history.","dc:creator":"unknown","dc:identifier":["0012_000553_000249_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4642"],"dc:date":["1894 - 1900","12/15/08"],"dc:subject":"Brown, Clarence, 1890-1987","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:relation":"0012_000553_000249_0001","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:source":"Clarence Brown Papers, MS.2010, Box 3, Folder 11","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville.

These suspicions are apparently confirmed when Van takes Whitey on an important business trip to Cuba. Linda is infuriated, but Whitey manages to convince her that her husband has never betrayed her, thus saving their marriage.","dc:creator":"unknown","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","dc:subject":["Brown, Clarence, 1890-1987","Motion picture producers and directors -- United States","Motion pictures -- United States"],"dc:language":"English","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections","dc:title":"Jean Harlow, Clark Gable, and Myrna Loy in \"Wife vs. Secretary\""}},"header":{"datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc","identifier":"spc_3823"}},{"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:source":"Anna Catherine Wiley Sketches Collection, MS.1287, Box 1, Folder 14 ","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:relation":"cw0114109","dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Brown received a double degree in mechanical and electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee in 1910 and then began a career selling automobiles in Alabama. Fascinated with movies, he moved to New Jersey where he studied with French director Maurice Tourneur at Peerless Studios. There, the pair directed The Last of the Mohicans (1920). Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in Chained (1934), Spencer Tracy in Edison the Man (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet (1945), and Gregory Peck in The Yearling (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films. When he died in 1987, Brown left $12 million to the University of Tennessee. When added to the $1 million donated during his lifetime, the sum made him the largest donor in the university's history.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:creator":"unknown","dc:identifier":["0012_000411_000213_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4375"],"dc:date":["1920 - 1954","01/10/08"],"dc:subject":["Motion picture directors and producers -- United States","Brown, Clarence, 1890-1987"],"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"}}},{"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:source":"Knoxville Gardens Slides, MS.1324","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:relation":"0012_000463_000301_0001","dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

The family lives near the signal tower where Tolliver works. When the relief signal man retires, his replacement Joe Standish (Wallace Beery) boards with the Tollivers. Standish is evicted after attempting to seduce Sally and arrives at work drunk and late the following night. As a result, Tolliver works an extra shift and Standish attempts to force himself on Sally while he is distracted. Sonny runs to his father for help, but Tolliver is busy preventing a freight train that has broken in half from colliding with the oncoming Limited. Sally takes matters into her own hands, and aims what she believes to be an unloaded gun at Standish. It discharges, however, hitting Standish and so dissuading him. Thus, both the train and Sally's honor are preserved.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:creator":"unknown","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:subject":["Brown, Clarence, 1890-1987","Motion picture producers and directors -- United States","Silent films -- United States"],"dc:relation":"0012_000107_000202_0001","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:source":"Clarence Brown Collection, 1920-1970, MS.0702, Box 6, Folder H2","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

He moved with his family to Knoxville, Tennessee as a child and graduated from Knoxville High School in 1905. Brown received a double degree in mechanical and electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee in 1910 and then began a career selling automobiles in Alabama. Fascinated with movies, he moved to New Jersey where he studied with French director Maurice Tourneur at Peerless Studios. There, the pair directed \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1920). Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in \"Chained\" (1934), Spencer Tracy in \"Edison the Man\" (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in \"National Velvet\" (1945), and Gregory Peck in \"The Yearling\" (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films. When he died in 1987, Brown left $12 million to the University of Tennessee. When added to the $1 million donated during his lifetime, the sum made him the largest donor in the university's history.","dc:creator":"unknown","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:subject":"Brown, Clarence, 1890-1987"}},"header":{"datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc","identifier":"spc_4637"}},{"header":{"identifier":"spc_4454","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc"},"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:title":"Courtroom Scene During Trial","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections","dc:language":"English","dc:subject":["Scopes Trial","Monkey Trial","Bryan, William Jennings, 1860-1925.","Darrow, Clarence, 1857-1938.","Robinson, Frank Earle, 1881-1957.","Robinson, Wallace Clarke, 1920-1995."],"xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","dc:description":"Scopes Trial Photographs, circa 1925, A-64 (3A), Courtroom Scene During Trial (prosecuting attorneys in center)","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:creator":"unknown","dc:date":"1925","dc:identifier":["0012_000128_000282_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4454"],"dc:source":"W.C.

He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

He is one of Catherine the Great's particular favorites, but he will not be kept as a lover and spurns her advances. When Kyrilla Troekouroff steals his lands, he creates a secret identity, \"The Black Eagle,\" and becomes a masked avenger. Although bent on revenge, he falls in love with Troekouroff's daughter, Mascha (Vilma Banky). Mascha, in turn, worships the Eagle but disdains his unmasked identity, her foppish French tutor Monsieur Le Blanc. Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate. Although captured by the Czarina's men, Catherine rescinds her orders to execute the Eagle and the pair escape to Paris.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:language":"English","dc:title":"Rudolph Valentino, Clarence Brown, and Arabella Brown on the Set of \"The Eagle\"","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections"}},"header":{"identifier":"spc_3788","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc"}},{"header":{"identifier":"spc_4411","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc"},"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:language":"English","dc:title":"F.

This concept excited Mayor Kyle Testerman, and he appointed banker Jake Butcher to head a committee to investigate the feasibility of such an event. The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:subject":[{},"Knoxville (Tenn.) -- Fairs","World's Fair of 1982 (Knoxville, Tenn.) -- Pictorial works","Exhibitions -- Tennessee -- Knoxville"],"dc:relation":"0012_000067_000679_0001","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:source":"Photographs of Tennessee Cities Collection, MS.0951, Box 2, Folder 9","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:source":"Photographs of Tennessee Cities Collection, MS.0951, Box 2, Folder 9","dc:relation":"0012_000067_000669_0001","dc:publisher":"University of Tennesse Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Fascinated with movies, he moved to New Jersey where he studied with French director Maurice Tourneur at Peerless Studios. There, the pair directed \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1920). Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in \"Chained\" (1934), Spencer Tracy in \"Edison the Man\" (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in \"National Velvet\" (1945), and Gregory Peck in \"The Yearling\" (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films. When he died in 1987, Brown left $12 million to the University of Tennessee. When added to the $1 million donated during his lifetime, the sum made him the largest donor in the university's history.","dc:creator":"unknown","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:identifier":["0012_000553_000247_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4640"],"dc:date":["1894 - 1900","12/15/08"],"dc:subject":"Brown, Clarence, 1890-1987","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:relation":"0012_000553_000247_0001","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:source":"Clarence Brown Papers, MS.2010, Box 3, Folder 11","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

Several wings were added in the 1950s, each named after one of the first co-eds to attend the University. Sophronia Strong's ghost was said to watch over the Hall's residents, appearing as a lady dressed in white on her birthday (February 17) and perpetrating various harmless pranks. The last residents of the hall moved out after the 2008 Spring Semester and the building was put to other uses.","dc:creator":"unknown","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:subject":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville","Knoxville (Tenn.) -- History"],"dc:relation":"0012_000106_000547_0001","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:source":"University of Tennessee Photograph and Slide Collection, AR.0018, Box 8, Folder 50","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986. In 2007, Soka sold the property to the National Park Service, which intends to restore and preserve it.","dc:creator":"unknown","dc:identifier":["0012_000411_000200_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4362"],"dc:date":["1935 - 1952","01/09/08"],"dc:title":"Pond on Gillette Ranch","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections","dc:language":"English","dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","dc:identifier":["0012_000067_000665_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4321"],"dc:date":["1982-05-01 - 1982-10-31","10/18/07"],"dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections, Knoxville, Tennessee","dc:title":"Peruvian Pavilion","dc:language":"English","dc:publisher":"University of Tennesse Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","dc:date":["1982-05-01 - 1982-10-31","10/18/07"],"dc:identifier":["0012_000067_000667_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4323"],"dc:source":"Photographs of Tennessee Cities Collection, MS.0951, Box 2, Folder 9","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:relation":"0012_000067_000667_0001","dc:publisher":"University of Tennesse Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

In 1906, Isaiah Ford purchased the building and moved it to Woodlawn Pike, where he used it as a private residence.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:creator":"unknown","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:subject":[{},"Knoxville (Tenn.) -- Fairs","World's Fair of 1982 (Knoxville, Tenn.) -- Pictorial works","Exhibitions -- Tennessee -- Knoxville"],"dc:language":"English","dc:title":"Technology and Lifestyle Center","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections, Knoxville, Tennessee"}}},{"header":{"identifier":"spc_3839","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc"},"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Gillette died in 1932, and his widow sold the property to prominent film director Clarence Brown in 1935. Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986. In 2007, Soka sold the property to the National Park Service, which intends to restore and preserve it.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:identifier":["0012_000411_000209_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4371"],"dc:date":["1935 - 1952","01/09/08"],"dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections","dc:title":"Clarence Brown's Plane in Front of Hangar","dc:language":"English","dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Brown received a double degree in mechanical and electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee in 1910 and then began a career selling automobiles in Alabama. Fascinated with movies, he moved to New Jersey where he studied with French director Maurice Tourneur at Peerless Studios. There, the pair directed The Last of the Mohicans (1920). Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in Chained (1934), Spencer Tracy in Edison the Man (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet (1945), and Gregory Peck in The Yearling (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films. When he died in 1987, Brown left $12 million to the University of Tennessee. When added to the $1 million donated during his lifetime, the sum made him the largest donor in the university's history.","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:source":"Clarence Brown Collection, MS.1023, Box 1, Folder 7","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:relation":"0012_000411_000212_0001","dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

W. Stuart Evans was the original visionary behind the event, which he intended to attract business to central Knoxville and away from suburban shopping malls.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986. In 2007, Soka sold the property to the National Park Service, which intends to restore and preserve it.","dc:identifier":["0012_000553_000204_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4626"],"dc:date":["1935 - 1952","10/15/07"],"dc:subject":["Los Angeles County (Calif.) -- Pictorial works","Brown, Clarence, 1890-1987"],"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"}}},{"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:source":"Photographs of Tennessee Cities Collection, MS.0951, Box 2, Folder 8","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:relation":"0012_000067_000631_0001","dc:publisher":"University of Tennesse Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Wayland led the colony for only a year, and tensions soon developed between those colonists who wanted to apply radical socialist ideals in order to bring about the \"coming nation\" and those who considered Ruskin a haven for such American concepts as political and economic independence. By 1899, this factionalism had caused the colony to disintegrate. The colony was put into receivership, sparking two years of lawsuits between the opposing groups over ownership and control of the Association. Although a few of the colony's members attempted to reestablish it in Georgia as the Ruskin Commonwealth, these efforts proved unsuccessful.","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:source":"Ruskin Settlement Collection, MS.1014, Box 2, Folder 8","dc:relation":"0012_000405_000200_0001","dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

This concept excited Mayor Kyle Testerman, and he appointed banker Jake Butcher to head a committee to investigate the feasibility of such an event. The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","dc:date":["1982-05-01 - 1982-10-31","10/18/07"],"dc:identifier":["0012_000067_000659_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4315"],"dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections, Knoxville, Tennessee","dc:title":"World's Fair Grounds Under Construction","dc:language":"English","dc:publisher":"University of Tennesse Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Gillette died in 1932, and his widow sold the property to prominent film director Clarence Brown in 1935. Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986. In 2007, Soka sold the property to the National Park Service, which intends to restore and preserve it.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:date":["1935 - 1952","10/15/07"],"dc:identifier":["0012_000553_000208_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4630"],"dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections","dc:title":"Gillette Ranch Billiard Room","dc:language":"English"}},"header":{"setSpec":"spc","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","identifier":"spc_4630"}},{"header":{"identifier":"spc_4621","setSpec":"spc","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z"},"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

He moved with his family to Knoxville, Tennessee as a child and graduated from Knoxville High School in 1905. Brown received a double degree in mechanical and electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee in 1910 and then began a career selling automobiles in Alabama. Fascinated with movies, he moved to New Jersey where he studied with French director Maurice Tourneur at Peerless Studios. There, the pair directed \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1920). Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in \"Chained\" (1934), Spencer Tracy in \"Edison the Man\" (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in \"National Velvet\" (1945), and Gregory Peck in \"The Yearling\" (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films. When he died in 1987, Brown left $12 million to the University of Tennessee. When added to the $1 million donated during his lifetime, the sum made him the largest donor in the university's history.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:creator":"unknown","dc:date":["1894 - 1900","12/15/08"],"dc:identifier":["0012_000553_000248_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4641"],"dc:subject":"Brown, Clarence, 1890-1987","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","dc:title":"Clarence Brown in Childhood","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections","dc:language":"English"}},"header":{"identifier":"spc_4641","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc"}},{"header":{"datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc","identifier":"spc_4228"},"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:relation":"0012_000067_000572_0001","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:source":"Photographs of Tennessee Cities Collection, MS.0951, Box 2, Folder 6","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986. In 2007, Soka sold the property to the National Park Service, which intends to restore and preserve it.","dc:identifier":["0012_000411_000207_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4369"],"dc:date":["1935 - 1952","01/09/08"],"dc:title":"Clarence Brown Plowing with Horses","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections","dc:language":"English","dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

After the White family established a farm away from this location, the structure was repurposed as the kitchen wing of the Kennedy residence on State Street. In 1906, Isaiah Ford purchased the building and moved it to Woodlawn Pike, where he used it as a private residence. It changed hands again in 1970, when the City Association of Women's Clubs purchased the home and moved it back to central Knoxville.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","dc:identifier":["0012_000067_000675_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4331"],"dc:date":["1982-05-01 - 1982-10-31","10/18/07"],"dc:subject":[{},"Knoxville (Tenn.) -- Fairs","World's Fair of 1982 (Knoxville, Tenn.) -- Pictorial works","Exhibitions -- Tennessee -- Knoxville"],"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"}},"header":{"setSpec":"spc","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","identifier":"spc_4331"}},{"header":{"setSpec":"spc","datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","identifier":"spc_4071"},"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:relation":"0012_000067_000415_0001","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:source":"Photographs of Tennessee Cities Collection, MS.0951, Box 2, Folder 5","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Several wings were added in the 1950s, each named after one of the first co-eds to attend the University.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

Smith and released in 1920. In the movie, Henry Sanford (Henry Woodward) is building a lighthouse at Keyport when he falls in love with Kate Leroy (Florence Deshon). Unfortunately, she is already married to wealthy Morgan Leroy (Jack McDonald). Simultaneously, Betty (Barbara Bedford), wife of master diver Caleb West (Broerkin Christians), attracts the attention of Bill Lacey (John Gilbert), who works with her husband.

A number of other major expansions were made in later years (including a merger with SCI Funeral Services of Tennessee) and Berry Funeral Home continues to operate as one of the most prestigious mortuary services in Tennessee.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:date":["1958","08/27/07"],"dc:identifier":["0012_000067_000528_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4184"],"dc:subject":["Promotion Service",{},"Knoxville (Tenn.) -- Buildings, Structures, Etc. -- Pictorial Works"],"xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"}},"header":{"datestamp":"2011-06-01T15:58:55Z","setSpec":"spc","identifier":"spc_4184"}},{"metadata":{"oai_dc:dc":{"dc:subject":["Tennessee","Artwork","Yearbooks"],"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","dc:creator":"Anna Catherine Wiley","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:description":"Illustration, inks","dc:identifier":["cw0203177","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4985"],"dc:date":"1895-1897","dc:title":"Yearbook Illustrations in Ink: Clubs","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections","dc:language":"English","dc:publisher":"University of Tennessee Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Zuleika becomes so drunk, however, that she confuses her prompts (even when reminded loudly from offstage by Irene Fellara) and the couple are booed off stage. Years later, Van and Fellara (Norma Shearer) meet in a hotel in Geneva and a series of antics ensue.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:creator":"unknown","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:source":"Photographs of Tennessee Cities Collection, MS.0951, Box 2, Folder 9","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:relation":"0012_000067_000690_0001","dc:publisher":"University of Tennesse Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville.

Although the group failed to have the treaty revoked, Menawa was instrumental in having a provision inserted allowing the Creek to obtain legal patents for their land. He, along with Opothle Yoholo, later fought alongside American troops against the Seminole in Alabama.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:creator":"unknown","dc:date":["1982-05-01 - 1982-10-31","10/18/07"],"dc:identifier":["0012_000067_000672_0001","http://kiva.lib.utk.edu/spc/items/show/4328"],"dc:subject":[{},"Knoxville (Tenn.) -- Fairs","World's Fair of 1982 (Knoxville, Tenn.) -- Pictorial works","Exhibitions -- Tennessee -- Knoxville"],"xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","dc:contributor":"University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections, Knoxville, Tennessee","dc:title":"Entrance to the World's Fair (Showing Neyland Stadium)","dc:language":"English","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.","xmlns:oai_dc":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/","dc:creator":"unknown","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd","dc:source":"Photographs of Tennessee Cities Collection, MS.0951, Box 2, Folder 9","dc:type":["still image","image/jpeg"],"dc:relation":"0012_000067_000661_0001","dc:publisher":"University of Tennesse Libraries, Digital Library Initiatives","dc:rights":"The copyright interests in this collection remain with the creator.

Several wings were added in the 1950s, each named after one of the first co-eds to attend the University. Sophronia Strong's ghost was said to watch over the Hall's residents, appearing as a lady dressed in white on her birthday (February 17) and perpetrating various harmless pranks.

The home was then located at the outskirts of town, allowing Thomas to farm and raise livestock. Railroad contractor Henry H. Thrasher purchased the house in about 1905 and remodeled it completely, adding porches, columns, and the brick exterior. He sold it in the late 1920s to a group of physicians, who renamed it the Howard-Henderson Hospital. It was briefly known as the Acuff Clinic before becoming the Kingston Pike Motel in the late 1950s. When that enterprise failed, the structure was remodeled and reopened as the Kingston Pike Nursing Home. It continued in this capacity until the early 1990s. It was home to a number of businesses, including a beauty parlor and a restaurant, before Sam Furrow purchased it in 1999.
