The wider Mekong Region includes Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and the Chinese Province of Yunnan. This book gives important insight into how future sustainability will depend on the development of effective governance mechanisms at the level of the Mekong region. Evidence highlights a limited set of critical dynamics that generate a high level of connectivity between these countries, including human migration, natural resource flows and increasing levels of private and State financial investments. Besides regional connectivity, this assessment considers cross-sectoral implications, in particular those between the water, food and energy sectors. The majority of nationally planned and implemented development decisions in the wider Mekong Region aim for either improved water access, increased energy supply or improved food security. Investments in any of these three sectors are critical as they are closely linked, harbouring potential trade-offs and unintended side effects.   Successfully managing the water, food and energy nexus demands an understanding of direct and indirect connections. A few identified connections are direct trade-offs, for example the use of water for either food or energy crops. Other connections are indirect and their estimated magnitude suggests their critical importance. Identified nexus criticalities include fish stock management, land tenure, risk management of monoculture plantations and migration dynamics. The sustainability of the wider Mekong region will partly depend on how successfully these processes can be managed. Managing nexus criticalities, in contrast to specific sectoral investments, represents an alternate and potentially effective locus of policy intervention and initiative. Using case studies that include mainstream dams in the lower Mekong basin, water diversions between Lao PDR and Thailand, investments in response to rising sea level, this volume provides critical information for researchers and policymakers.    The research was generously funded and supported through the AusAID CSIRO Alliance.   0aEconomics. 0aFinance.14aEconomics/Management Science.24aFinance/Investment/Banking.24aWater Policy/Water Governance/Water Management.24aEnergy Policy, Economics and Management.24aFinancial Economics.1 aWard, John.eeditor.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978146146119740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-6120-3  aZDB-2-SBE  aBusiness and Economics (Springer-11643)03817nam a22004575i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001600184072002300200082001500223100003300238245011800271264009800389300003200487336002600519337002600545338003600571347002400607505043100631520185101062650002802913650001802941650002502959650002502984650001703009650002503026650001803051650004203069650004303111710003403154773002003188776003603208856004803244912001403292950005303306978-1-61091-232-7DE-He21320140403022128.0cr nn 008mamaa140401s2012    xxu|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97816109123279978-1-61091-232-77 a10.5822/978-1-61091-232-72doi 4aQH75-77 7aRNK2bicssc 7aNAT0110002bisacsh04a333.722231 aSchaller, George B.eauthor.10aTibet Wildh[electronic resource] :bA Naturalist’s Journeys on the Roof of the World /cby George B.

Throughout his celebrated career, Schaller has spent more time in Tibet than in any other part of the world, devoting more than thirty years to the wildlife, culture, and landscapes that captured his heart and continue to compel him to protect them. Tibet Wild is Schaller’s account of three decades of exploration in the most remote stretches of Tibet: the wide, sweeping rangelands of the Chang Tang and the hidden canyons and plunging ravines of the southeastern forests. As engaging as he is enlightening, Schaller illustrates the daily struggles of a field biologist trying to traverse the impenetrable Chang Tang, discover the calving grounds of the chiru or Tibetan antelope, and understand the movements of the enigmatic snow leopard. As changes in the region accelerated over the years, with more roads, homes, and grazing livestock, Schaller watched the clash between wildlife and people become more common—and more destructive. Thus what began as a purely scientific endeavor became a mission: to work with local communities, regional leaders, and national governments to protect the unique ecological richness and culture of the Tibetan Plateau. Whether tracking brown bears, penning fables about the tiny pika, or promoting a conservation preserve that spans the borders of four nations, Schaller has pursued his goal with a persistence and good humor that will inform and charm readers.  Tibet Wild is an intimate journey through the changing wilderness of Tibet, guided by the careful gaze and unwavering passion of a life-long naturalist. 0aEnvironmental sciences. 0aBiodiversity. 0aWildlife management. 0aNature Conservation.14aEnvironment.24aNature Conservation.24aBiodiversity.24aFish & Wildlife Biology & Management.24aClimate Change/Climate Change Impacts.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978159726458740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5822/978-1-61091-232-7  aZDB-2-EES  aEarth and Environmental Science (Springer-11646)03487nam a22006015i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001700186072002300203082001600226100003300242245027000275264008200545300004200627336002600669337002600695338003600721347002400757505031100781520105201092650001402144650002102158650002302179650001402202650002402216650003002240650001402270650002702284650004002311650002302351650002102374700003002395700003702425700002702462700003102489700002902520700002702549700002902576700003102605700003302636700003402669710003402703773002002737776003602757856004802793912001402841950003002855978-1-907673-94-8DE-He21320140723143018.0cr nn 008mamaa140528s2013    xxk|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97819076739489978-1-907673-94-87 a10.1007/978-1-907673-94-82doi 4aRC254-282 7aMJCL2bicssc 7aMED0620002bisacsh04a616.9942231 aAlvarez, Ricardo H.eauthor.10aHandbook of HER2-targeted agents in breast cancerh[electronic resource] /cby Ricardo H Alvarez, Javier Cortés, Leticia Mattos-Arruda, Mary Falzon, Angelica Fasolo, Michael Gandy, Luca Gianni, Nadia Harbeck, Martine Piccart, Stefania Zambelli, Dimitrios Zardavas. 1aTarporley :bSpringer Healthcare Ltd. :bImprint: Springer Healthcare,c2013.  aXI, 96 p. 13 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aIntroduction and background biology -- HER2 testing -- HER2-positive breast cancer: adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy -- HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: first-line treatment -- HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: second-line treatment -- Emerging targeted agents for HER2-positive breast cancer.  aBreast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total new cancer cases each year.  Of these cases, approximately  15–25% overexpress HER2, a transmembrane RTK kinase that is associated with aggressive tumor growth and poor outcomes.  However, in the past decade, survival rates of patients with HER-positive breast cancer have significantly improved due to increased screening, HER2 testing, and breakthrough HER2-targeted drug therapies.

The pharmacological options are considered alongside psychosocial management approaches and the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment modality are outlined. The entries are written by leading experts, including basic and clinical scientists in academia and industry, and include descriptions of many relevant fundamental psychological and biological processes of the disorder. The volume owes much to the Encyclopedia of Psychopharmacology edited by Ian Stolerman IP (published by Springer-Verlag in 2010), from which some entries are reproduced. Where entries deal with pharmacological interventions, the aim is to provide detailed information on the neuropsychopharmacology of the substances from domains such as clinical, experimental, and molecular pharmacology, insofar as they impact upon understanding of schizophrenia. Articles on non-drug interventions review the most recent evidence base related to commonly applied psychotherapeutic and rehabilitative measures. Other essays focus upon the key concepts and research methods used in the field, describing the main features of investigative techniques and outlining their roles, the types of information obtained and why they are needed; the advantages and limitations of a technique may also be summarized. The essays are complemented by many short definitions of important terms; in the interest of ease of reading, these definitions are not assigned to named authors; they are typically related to specific essays that they cross-reference and relevant authorship details can be found in the latter.   0aMedicine. 0aPsychiatry. 0aPsychopharmacology. 0aPsychotherapy. 0aPsychology, clinical. 0aApplied psychology.14aMedicine & Public Health.24aPsychiatry.24aPsychopharmacology.24aPsychotherapy.24aClinical Psychology.24aPsychotherapy and Counseling.1 aStolerman, Ian P.eeditor.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978190767317740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-907673-96-2  aZDB-2-SME  aMedicine (Springer-11650)02325nam a22004335i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050000700172072001500179072002300194082001200217100003300229245011200262264008200374300005100456336002600507337002600533338003600559347002400595505031500619520061500934650001401549650001401563650002601577650003001603650003701633650001401670650002501684710003401709773002001743776003601763856004801799912001401847950003001861978-1-908517-66-1DE-He21320140602110959.0cr nn 008mamaa140602s2012    xxk|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97819085176619978-1-908517-66-17 a10.1007/978-1-908517-66-12doi 4aR1 7aMB2bicssc 7aMED0000002bisacsh04a6102231 aBosworth, Hayden B.eauthor.10aEnhancing Medication Adherenceh[electronic resource] :bThe Public Health Dilemma /cby Hayden B Bosworth. 1aTarporley :bSpringer Healthcare Ltd. :bImprint: Springer Healthcare,c2012.  aIX, 60 p. 2 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aDefining medication nonadherence -- Causes of medication nonadherence -- Methods for determining medication adherence -- Evaluating adherence-enhancing interventions -- The role of healthcare providers in medication adherence -- Medication intervention recommendations -- Future directions and recommendations.  aEnhancing Medication Adherence: The Public Health Dilemma is a comprehensive guide to medication adherence for the healthcare professional.

In 2013, Josef Ackermann, former CEO of Deutsche Bank, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Zurich Insurance Group , offers his analysis of the banking Union, Lord Dykes, Foreign Affairs Spokesperson for the LibDems in the House of Lords, provides readers with his view of the future for the UK in the European Union and Alain Lamassoure, MEP, Chairman of the Budget Committee in the European Parliament, suggests a budgetary federation.The very best specialists help to throw light on the major trends ongoing in the economy and also in international and European politics. This book includes around 35 maps that are often unique, in explanation of the major issues the Union is facing. It also includes a summary of political Europe which analyses the 2012 electoral year (among France, Greece, The Netherlands, Romania), looks into the political and economic representation of women in Europe and draws up an overview of normative output in the Union in 2012. A unique series of commented statistics and maps covers all of the main topical issues (growth, buying power, economy, demography, immigration, energy, environment) and enables the Schuman Report 2013 to present a full view of the European Union and its policies. 0aEconomics. 0aEconomic policy. 0aEuropexEconomic policy. 0aFinance. 0aCommercial law.14aEconomics/Management Science.24aEconomic Policy.24aEuropean Integration.24aFinancial Economics.24aLaw and Economics.1 aFoucher, Michel.eeditor.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978281780450740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-2-8178-0451-4  aZDB-2-SBE  aBusiness and Economics (Springer-11643)02343nam a22004215i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199082001200222100002800234245011200262264006000374300003200434336002600466337002600492338003600518347002400554490003400578520097000612650001701582650001801599650001701617650002601634650002701660710003401687773002001721776003601741830003401777856004801811912001401859950004801873978-3-0348-0393-9DE-He21320140516172121.0cr nn 008mamaa140515s2012    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830348039399978-3-0348-0393-97 a10.1007/978-3-0348-0393-92doi 4aQA1-939 7aPB2bicssc 7aMAT0000002bisacsh04a5102231 aWilliams, Kim.eeditor.10aArchitecture, Systems Research and Computational Sciencesh[electronic resource] /cedited by Kim Williams. 1aBasel :bSpringer Basel :bImprint: Birkhäuser,c2012.  aV, 195 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aNexus Network Journal ;v14,1  aThe Winter 2012 (vol. 14 no. 1) issue of the Nexus Network Journal is dedicated to the theme “Architecture, Systems Research and Computational Sciences”. This is an outgrowth of the session by the same name which took place during the eighth international, interdisciplinary conference “Nexus 2010: Relationships between Architecture and Mathematics, held in Porto, Portugal, in June 2010. Today computer science is an integral part of even strictly historical investigations, such as those concerning the construction of vaults, where the computer is used to survey the existing building, analyse the data and draw the ideal solution. What the papers in this issue make especially evident is that information technology has had an impact at a much deeper level as well: architecture itself can now be considered as a manifestation of information and as a complex system. The issue is completed with other research papers, conference reports and book reviews. 0aMathematics. 0aArchitecture.14aMathematics.24aMathematics, general.24aArchitecture, general.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9783034803922 0aNexus Network Journal ;v14,140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-0348-0393-9  aZDB-2-SMA  aMathematics and Statistics (Springer-11649)03136nam a22004335i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001600184072002300200082001500223100003200238245012000270264008200390300004700472336002600519337002600545338003600571347002400607505034700631520141100978650001402389650001502403650001302418650003002431650001502461650001302476700003102489710003402520773002002554776003602574856004802610912001402658950003002672978-3-642-20086-1DE-He21320140508093343.0cr nn 008mamaa140508s2011    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836422008619978-3-642-20086-17 a10.1007/978-3-642-20086-12doi 4aRB1-214 7aMMF2bicssc 7aMED0670002bisacsh04a616.072231 aRekhtman, Natasha.eauthor.10aQuick Reference Handbook for Surgical Pathologistsh[electronic resource] /cby Natasha Rekhtman, Justin A.

The authors are early-career pathologists who have compiled this book from the perspective of pathologists-in-training. The focus is not organ-based histologic criteria, but rather everything else that goes into pathologic diagnoses but is difficult to keep committed to memory. The emphasis is on immunohistochemistry, special stains, grading systems, molecular markers, tumor syndromes, and helpful clinical references. Also included are morphologic summaries that encompass high-yield material cutting across all organ systems, such as an illustrated guide for microorganisms, tumor differentials, and an illustrated glossary. The book has a unique format in that the information is presented primarily in tables and diagrams accompanied by minimal explanatory text. The guiding principle was to boil the information down to the essentials but with just enough commentary to be accessible to a newcomer to pathology. This book is intended to serve as a ‘peripheral brain’ for pathology residents where frequently needed information is readily accessible and easy to navigate.  The book may also be of interest to practicing pathologists as a quick reference by the microscope.  0aMedicine. 0aPathology. 0aSurgery.14aMedicine & Public Health.24aPathology.24aSurgery.1 aBishop, Justin A.eauthor.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978364220085440uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-20086-1  aZDB-2-SME  aMedicine (Springer-11650)03179nam a22004815i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172050001200188072001500200072002300215072002300238082001400261100002800275245011900303264008200422300003300504336002600537337002600563338003600589347002400625505074300649520086401392650001702256650001502273650002802288650002402316650001702340650005202357650005002409650002802459700002502487710003402512773002002546776003602566856004802602912001402650950003302664978-3-642-30087-5DE-He21320141213031429.0cr nn 008mamaa141212s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836423008759978-3-642-30087-57 a10.1007/978-3-642-30087-52doi 4aTA405-409.3 4aQA808.2 7aTG2bicssc 7aTEC0090702bisacsh 7aTEC0210002bisacsh04a620.12231 aFang, Daining.eauthor.10aFracture Mechanics of Piezoelectric and Ferroelectric Solidsh[electronic resource] /cby Daining Fang, Jinxi Liu. 1aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXX, 417 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aIntroduction -- Physical and Material Properties of Dielectrics -- Fracture of Piezoelectric/Ferroelectric Materials-Experiments and Results -- Basic Equations of Piezoelectric Materials -- General Solutions to Electromechanical Coupling Problems of Piezoelectric Materials -- Fracture Mechanics of Homogeneous Piezoelectric Materials -- Interface Fracture Mechanics of Piezoelectric Materials -- Dynamic Fracture Mechanics of Piezoelectric Materials -- Nonlinear Fracture Mechanics of Ferroelectric Materials -- Fracture Criteria -- Electroelastic Concentrations Induced by Electrodes in Piezoelectric Materials -- Electric-Induced Fatigue Fracture -- Numerical Method for Analyzing Fracture of Piezoelectric and Ferroelectric Materials.  aFracture Mechanics of Piezoelectric and Ferroelectric Solids presents a systematic and comprehensive coverage of the fracture mechanics of piezoelectric/ferroelectric materials, which includes the theoretical analysis, numerical computations and experimental observations.

"Remote Sensing Modeling and Applications to Wildland Fires" addresses wildland fire management needs by presenting discussions that link ecology and the physical sciences from local to regional levels, views on integrated decision support data for policy and decision makers, new technologies and techniques, and future challenges and how remote sensing might help to address them. While creating awareness of wildland fire management and rehabilitation issues, hands-on experience in applying remote sensing and simulation modeling is also shared. This book will be a useful reference work for researchers, practitioners and graduate students in the fields of fire science, remote sensing and modeling applications. Professor John J.

It starts from the basics of material science, describing the material and its growth, defect and electrical properties, the basics of its interaction with photons and the involved statistics, proceeding to space charge effects in semiconductors and pn-junctions. Most attention is given to analyze homo- and hetero-junction solar cells using various models and applying the field-of-direction analysis for discussing current voltage characteristics, and helping to discover the involvement of high-field effects in solar cells. The comprehensive coverage of the main topics of - and relating to - solar cells with extensive reference to literature helps scientists and engineers at all levels to reach a better understanding and im provement of solar cell properties and their production. The author is one of the founders of thin film solar cell research. 0aMicrowaves. 0aRenewable energy sources. 0aSurfaces (Physics).14aEnergy.24aRenewable and Green Energy.24aSemiconductors.24aMicrowaves, RF and Optical Engineering.24aApplied and Technical Physics.24aOptics, Optoelectronics, Plasmonics and Optical Devices.24aSurfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978364236747240uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36748-9  aZDB-2-ENE  aEnergy (Springer-40367)02942nam a22005055i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072002300204082001600227100002800243245015800271264008200429300004700511336002600558337002600584338003600610347002400646490006700670505024900737520086900986650002801855650002601883650001901909650002901928650001701957650003701974650002302011650004502034700002902079700002602108700003002134710003402164773002002198776003602218830006702254856004802321912001402369950005302383978-3-642-37874-4DE-He21320150113101606.0cr nn 008mamaa150113s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836423787449978-3-642-37874-47 a10.1007/978-3-642-37874-42doi 4aTD172-193.5 7aTQK2bicssc 7aSCI0260002bisacsh04a363.7372231 aZhou, Jinsong.eauthor.10aMercury Emission and its Control in Chinese Coal-Fired Power Plantsh[electronic resource] /cby Jinsong Zhou, Zhongyang Luo, Yanqun Zhu, Mengxiang Fang. 1aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aApprox. 200 p. 80 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aAdvanced Topics in Science and Technology in China,x1995-68190 aMercury Sampling and Measurement in Coal-fired Power Plants -- Mercury Emissions Estimation from Chinese Coal-fired Power Plants -- Mercury Speciation Transformation during Coal Combustion -- Mercury Control and Mercury Stability in Byproducts.  a"Mercury Emission and its Control in Chinese Coal-Fired Power Plants" focuses on investigating mercury emissions samplings and measurement in Chinese coal-fired power plants, mercury emission estimations and future trends, mercury speciation transformation during coal combustion, mercury control and mercury stability in byproducts.

The book asks what it takes to achieve sustainable impact: to know your clients and to understand their needs, to treat them in a fair and transparent way, and to safeguard the synthesis between the financial and social dimension of sustainable microfinance. The book also sheds light on the future funding landscape and what is necessary to bring more commercial funders on board while ensuring that these new funders will continue the commitment to responsible finance.While being forward looking, the book reflects the debate on core values of microfinance, triggered by recent criticisms of an approach that was hailed as a panacea in the beginning and which had proved over time as one of the most effective models of development finance. These criticisms emerged over signs of overheating in some markets, particularly the 2010 events in Andhra Pradesh, and turned into an assumption of a worldwide microfinance crisis, putting seriously at stake the good reputation microfinance had enjoyed so far. Half of the world, and 80 percent of the poor, are excluded from formal financial services. This means that they have to rely on the age-old, informal alternatives that can be unreliable and expensive. Microfinance 3.0 is a highly welcome contribution to the frontiers of financial inclusion – a world in which poor households in the informal economy can access and use the broad range of financial services they need to create livelihoods, smooth consumption, and better manage risks.      Tilman Ehrbeck, CEO CGAP (Consultative Group For The Poor)   0aEconomics. 0aEthics. 0aDevelopment Economics. 0aEndogenous growth (Economics). 0aFinance.14aEconomics/Management Science.24aDevelopment Economics.24aFinancial Economics.24aFinance/Investment/Banking.24aBusiness Strategy/Leadership.24aEthics.24aEconomic Growth.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978364241703040uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41704-7  aZDB-2-SBE  aBusiness and Economics (Springer-11643)03496nam a22004935i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001700185072001600202072002300218082001700241100003000258245017800288264005800466300003800524336002600562337002600588338003600614347002400650490003700674505023600711520156400947650001402511650002402525650002102549650003002570650002502600650006402625700003102689700003102720700003202751710003402783773002002817776003602837830003702873856004802910912001402958950003002972978-88-470-5364-9DE-He21320140530124715.0cr nn 008mamaa140530s2013    it |    s    |||| 0|ita d  a97888470536499978-88-470-5364-97 a10.1007/978-88-470-5364-92doi 4aR895-920 7aMMPH2bicssc 7aMMP2bicssc 7aMED0080002bisacsh04a616.07572231 aCoriasco, Mario.eauthor.10aL’immagine digitale in diagnostica per immaginih[electronic resource] :bTecniche e applicazioni /cby Mario Coriasco, Nello Balossino, Osvaldo Rampado, Sergio Rabellino. 1aMilano :bSpringer Milan :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXIII, 209 pagg.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aImaging & Formazione,x2239-20170 a1 Rappresentazione digitale di segnali -- 2 Luce, immagini e visione -- 3 Introduzione all'immagine digitale -- 4 Elaborazione di immagini -- 5 Elaborazioni intrinseche alle metodiche -- 6 La memorizzazione delle immagini digitali.  aIl volume illustra i fondamenti necessari per acquisire, elaborare e valutare le immagini radiologiche con un approccio interdisciplinare, che coniuga contributi di fisica, informatica biomedica e radiologia. Dopo un’introduzione al trattamento digitale di segnali e alla psicofisiologia della visione, vengono descritti i parametri caratteristici e gli indicatori di qualità delle immagini digitali, passando poi alle principali tecniche di elaborazione delle immagini, sia nel dominio spaziale sia in quello delle frequenze. Sono trattati gli algoritmi per il filtraggio, le tecniche di segmentazione, con dettaglio specifico per le diverse metodiche di imaging, concludendo con una rassegna dei principali formati di memorizzazione tra cui lo standard più diffuso per le immagini ad uso medico, il DICOM. Il testo è corredato da schede di autovalutazione ed esercizi che permettono di verificare il proprio livello di apprendimento dei concetti affrontati. Inoltre, a complemento dell'opera, il lettore potrà accedere, tramite un software gratuito, a un vero e proprio laboratorio di elaborazione di immagini con il quale potrà esercitarsi a riprodurre personalmente gli esempi di elaborazione illustrati.

We analyze the origin of such flows and their geometric and variational nature. Some of the most important aspects of mean curvature flow are described, such as the comparison principle and its use in the definition of suitable weak solutions. The anisotropic evolutions, which can be considered as a generalization of mean curvature flow, are studied from the view point of Finsler geometry. Concerning singular perturbations, we discuss the convergence of the Allen–Cahn (or Ginsburg–Landau) type equations to (possibly anisotropic) mean curvature flow before the onset of singularities in the limit problem. We study such kinds of asymptotic problems also in the static case, showing convergence to prescribed curvature-type problems. 0aMathematics. 0aGeometry.14aMathematics.24aGeometry.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9788876424281 0aPublications of the Scuola Normale Superiore ;v1240uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-88-7642-429-8  aZDB-2-SMA  aMathematics and Statistics (Springer-11649)02039nam a22004095i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001600186072002300202082001400225100003600239245009300275264008000368300003700448336002600485337002600511338003600537347002400573490005500597505023400652520042800886650001301314650001301327650003401340710003401374773002001408776003601428830005501464856004801519912001401567950004801581978-88-7642-482-3DE-He21320141204113039.0cr nn 008mamaa141204s2013    it |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97888764248239978-88-7642-482-37 a10.1007/978-88-7642-482-32doi 4aQC770-798 7aPHP2bicssc 7aSCI0510002bisacsh04a539.72231 aPetrucciani, Giovanni.eauthor.14aThe Search for the Higgs Boson at CMSh[electronic resource] /cby Giovanni Petrucciani. 1aPisa :bScuola Normale Superiore :bImprint: Edizioni della Normale,c2013.  aApprox. 200 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aPublications of the Scuola Normale Superiore ;v180 aThe standard model of elementary particles and the Higgs boson -- The CMS experiment at the CERN LHC.- Searches for a Higgs boson at CMS, in the different final states -- Statistical analysis for Higgs boson searches -- Results.  aThis book describes the searches that lead to the discovery of a Higgs boson performed at CMS, one of the two main experiments at the CERN LHC.

What we consume, how, and how much, has consequences of great moral importance for humans, animals, and the environment. Great challenges lie ahead as we are facing population growth and climate change and reduced availability of fossil fuels. It is often argued that key to meeting those challenges is changing consumption patterns among individual as well as institutions, for instance through reducing meat consumption, switching to organic or fair trade products, boycotting or 'buycotting' certain products, or consuming less overall. There is considerable disagreement regarding how to bring this about, whose responsibility it is, and even whether it is desirable. Is it a question of political initiatives, producer responsibility, the virtues and vices of individual consumers in the developed world, or something else? Many of these issues pose profound intellectual challenges at the intersection of ethics, political philosophy, economics, and several other fields. This publication brings together contributions from scholars in numerous disciplines, including philosophy, law, economics, sociology and animal welfare, who explore the theme of 'the ethics of consumption' from different angles. 0aLife sciences.14aLife Sciences.24aLife Sciences, general.1 aSandin, Per.eeditor.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/978-90-8686-784-4  aZDB-2-SBL  aBiomedical and Life Sciences (Springer-11642)03649nam a22005535i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001500172050001500187050001500202072001700217072001600234072002300250072002300273082001400296082001400310100003200324245015400356264006700510300003500577336002600612337002600638338003600664347002400700490004000724505025300764520159201017650001902609650001802628650002102646650002102667650001902688650003302707650003402740650001802774700003002792700003102822710003402853773002002887776003602907830004002943856004802983912001403031950005003045978-94-007-5316-7DE-He21320150321053148.0cr nn 008mamaa150321s2012    ne |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97894007531679978-94-007-5316-77 a10.1007/978-94-007-5316-72doi 4aQH541.5.W3 4aQH541.5.F7 4aQH541.5.S3 7aPSAF2bicssc 7aPSP2bicssc 7aSCI0200002bisacsh 7aSCI0390002bisacsh04a577.622304a577.72231 aPurcell, Jennifer.eeditor.10aJellyfish Blooms IVh[electronic resource] :bInteractions with humans and fisheries /cedited by Jennifer Purcell, Hermes Mianzan, Jesscia R.

There is concern that environmental changes such as global warming, eutrophication, over-fishing, and coastal construction may benefit jellyfish populations. During this past decade following the first Jellyfish Blooms volume, some species have bloomed more frequently, expanded their range, and caused more problems for humans. Mnemiopsis leidyi, the ctenophore that invaded the Black Sea in the 1980s and damaged fisheries, now also blooms in the North, Baltic, and Mediterranean seas. Nemopilema nomurai, a giant Asian jellyfish, has bloomed frequently during this decade, causing severe damage to the Japanese fishing industry. Jellyfish Blooms: Interactions with Humans and Fisheries is the fourth volume in this series. Syntheses and original research articles address the question if jellyfish have increased globally and what factors may have contributed to the abundance of jellyfish. This volume is the most extensive to date, containing papers from all continents (except Antarctica) on scyphozoans, hydrozoans, cubozoans, staurozoans, and ctenophores, and on the fate of jellyfish blooms. This is a key reference for students and professional marine biologists, oceanographers, and fishery scientists and managers.Previously published in Hydrobiologia, vol. 690, 2012 Previously published in Hydrobiologia, vol. 690, 2012 0aLife sciences. 0aOceanography. 0aAquatic biology. 0aMarine Sciences.14aLife Sciences.24aFreshwater & Marine Ecology.24aMarine & Freshwater Sciences.24aOceanography.1 aMianzan, Hermes.eeditor.1 aFrost, Jesscia R.eeditor.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9789400753150 0aDevelopments in Hydrobiology ;v22040uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-5316-7  aZDB-2-SBL  aBiomedical and Life Sciences (Springer-11642)05501nam a22005775i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001700188072002300205082001200228100002800240245020400268264006700472300003300539336002600572337002600598338003600624347002400660490004000684505275900724520079603483650001904279650001304298650001804311650002104329650001804350650002204368650001904390650001304409650001804422650003304440650002004473650002904493700003604522700003304558700003004591700003004621700003004651710003404681773002004715776003604735830004004771856004804811912001404859950005004873978-94-007-5790-5DE-He21320150321032128.0cr nn 008mamaa150321s2012    ne |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97894007579059978-94-007-5790-57 a10.1007/978-94-007-5790-52doi 4aQH540-549.5 7aPSAF2bicssc 7aSCI0200002bisacsh04a5772231 aSalmaso, Nico.eeditor.10aPhytoplankton responses to human impacts at different scalesh[electronic resource] /cedited by Nico Salmaso, Luigi Naselli-Flores, Leonardo Cerasino, Giovanna Flaim, Monica Tolotti, Judit Padisák. 1aDordrecht :bSpringer Netherlands :bImprint: Springer,c2012.  aVI, 386 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aDevelopments in Hydrobiology ;v2210 a1.

A wide spectrum of case studies describe the effects due to eutrophication and climate change, as well as other impacts connected with watershed management, hydrological alterations and introduction of non-indigenous species. The volume also includes two wide reviews on planktonic coccoid green algae and planktic heterocytous cyanobacteria. This book is addressed to ecologists and scientists involved in phytoplankton ecology and taxonomy. Many case studies provide a sound scientific basis of knowledge for a wise management of water bodies.
